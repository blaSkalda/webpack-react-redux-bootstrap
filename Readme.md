# Webpack React Redux template
## Start up 

Before start, you will need to install: 
 - nodejs

After you install nodejs on you machine then run this command:
 - `npm install yarn -g`

After successful installation go to folder with project and run:
 - `yarn`

This should install all dependencies for you to start going. 

### Start coding 

To see, if everything is working then try `yarn watch` to run this simple template on your local machine.

App is using React and Redux, witch mocks API reponses via `webpack` proxy (see `webpack.dev.js`) 

### Troubleshooting 
Potentionaly you will need `python` and `C++ tool build` but I'm not sure :)
